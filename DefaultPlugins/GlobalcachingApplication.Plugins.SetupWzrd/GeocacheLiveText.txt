Globalcaching Application is Geocaching Live Enabled.

With the Geocaching Live API from Groundspeak it becomes easy to obtain data from geocaching.com and e.g. log a geocache without the need to go to the website of geocaching.com.
Pocket Queries can be downloaded right from the application itself and geocaches can be updated instantly.

In order to use these features, you have to authorize this application to access your account on geocaching.com.
